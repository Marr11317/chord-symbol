Many thanks for reading this and considering contributing to this project, this is fantastic!

- full unit tests suite must be passing: `npm test`
- 100% code coverage must be maintained
- no eslint errors/warnings `npx eslint -- src tests`

All of those checks are automated if you try to build the application: `npm build`:
- please do not commit the resulting files in the PR
- a build failure is fine if it concerns npm outdated dependencies npm security issues
