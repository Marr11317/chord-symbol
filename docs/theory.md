Don't forget that the terms used in the first column are chord descriptions, while the terms used in the second and third columns are interval descriptions. 
(Note therefore that the term dominant 7th is a chord description and not an interval description - we have already derived all necessary interval descriptions in Chapter 2 - however I still sometimes hear even experienced musicians make the mistake of referring to "dominant 7th intervals"! 

Don't forget that the dominant 7th chord contains a minor 7th interval within it, as shown above).

The point is that, while technically we could manipulate the intervals of a major 7th chord to create a dominant 7th chord as described at the top of this page, what we have actually done is created a brand-new chord - there is no way that a dominant 7th chord would be considered an 'altered' version of a major 7th chord, and vice-versa. Each unique combination of 3rd and 7th intervals (or in some cases, 3rd and 6th intervals) in the chord summary table on p227, creates an entirely new and different chord in each case - and we have already agreed that it is the combination of the 3rd and 7th (or 6th) intervals which is giving the 'vertical quality' to the each of these different chords, as in the discussion on p159-160. This leads to the fol- lowing conclusions regarding four-part (or larger) chord forms:-
- The third and seventh (or sixth) intervals within a chord, together define the basic chord quality (i.e. major, dominant etc) of that chord.
- If any of these basic 'definitive' tones of a chord are changed, the result is never an 'altered' version of the original chord - instead an entirely new chord has been created.
- However, other parts of the chord (i.e. the 5th) which do not contribute to this basic definition of the chord, may be altered (i.e. flatted or sharped) and the result will still be considered as an 'altered' version of the original chord - as we will see in this chapter.
- Any chord symbol which refers to an 'altered' 3rd or 7th (or 6th) is completely incorrect. Occasionally you may encounter horrific chord symbols like 'C7(b3)' for a Cmi7 chord, or 'Cma7(b3)' for a CmiMa7 chord - beware!!

with regard to chord symbols which consist solely of a root note name followed by a number (i.e. with no other suffix or qualification):-
- If the number in the chord symbol is less than 7 (i.e. as in the chord symbol C6) the chord has a major quality or implication.
- If the number in the chord symbol is 7 or greater (i.e. as in the chord symbols G7 and G9) the chord has a dominant quality or implication.

From a harmony standpoint, I believe that this is an incorrect usage of the number '2' - for example, while technically the note D is a whole-step above the note C, there is no such thing as the '2nd' of a C major chord - the note D is correctly termed a ninth on a C major chord (as seen in Fig. 2.17.) as it really is an upper extension of the chord, regardless of where it is actually 'voiced' in the chord or which other chord tones may be present. 

Dominant = with 3 + b7


Major chords

Note that the 11th of the above major chord is in fact a sharped 11th, as the perfect 11th (F in this case) would clash with the 3rd of the chord (E in this case). If the perfect 11th (4th) was used on the major chord, this would typically be a suspension (see Fig 1.31.) where the 3rd was not used - more about the suspended major chord later in this chapter.

Note that the following ‘enharmonic’ or duplicate functions exist within these chords:
- The flatted 5th (Gb) of the Cma7(b5) chord is the enharmonic equivalent of the sharped 11th (F#) of the C69(#11), Cma9(#11) and Cma13(#11) chords. Generally this pitch is referred to as a flatted 5th on the major chord, unless the (perfect) 5th is also present within the chord - in which case this pitch is usually referred to as a sharped 11th.
- The 6th (A) of the C6, C69 and C69(#11) chords is the same pitch as the 13th (also A) of the Cma13(#11) chord. Generally this pitch is referred to as a 6th on the major chord, unless the 7th (typically in combination with the 9th and/or #11th) is also present within the chord - in which case this pitch is usually referred to as a 13th.

Dominant

For the great majority of Western music applications, the 3rd and 4th/11th would be mutually exclusive on this chord, i.e. they would not be ‘voiced’ at the same time. However, movement between the 3rd and 4th/11th can occur if multiple voicings are used within the ‘duration’ of the same dominant chord, as seen in the melody examples in this chapter. In these situations we can say that the dominant chord is being alternately suspended and unsuspended.

Note that whereas the chord functions 6th and 13th are sometimes used interchangeably for major-type and mi6/miMa7th-type chords (see Chapters 4 & 7), on the G dominant 7th- type chord the note E should always be referred to as a 13th (not a 6th), as it will always be an upper extension on this chord and not a ‘basic’ chord tone (assuming that the b7th is present).
